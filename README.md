<h1>D0CUT0D</h1>
<p><b>d0cut0d</b>, is document-site inspired by <a href="https://github.com/slatedocs/slate">slatejs</a>. There no surprise yet, I just create this to increase my React skill and also to learn Gatsby too. <b>d0cut0d</b> is using Gatsby and its specialization to read *.yaml file. So basically you will access and customize the site documentation from `/content/article.yaml`, it's really easy since the yaml file so structured and easy to understand.</p>
<p>why using <b>d0cut0d</b> rather slatejs ?, i don't recommend using this unless you want to use very simple documentation, and or if you want to fork and customize it.</p>
